# Doppler skeleton sample

This sample contains a simple web page that shows how to...

- initiate web page rendering;
- use HTML and CSS quasiquotes;
- use variable interpolation in templates;
- react to DOM events;
- update application state.

After building the main project, you can light up your favorite web server
and set www root to `dist/build/doppler-sample-skeleton/doppler-sample-skeleton.jsexe`.

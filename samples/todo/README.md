## Doppler TODO sample

This sample contains a TODO app where you can add things to do. It shows how to...

- render a list of dynamic values;
- bind a value to input box;
- update state from input box events;
- add attributes that depend on state.

After building the main project, you can light up your favorite web server
and set www root to `dist/build/doppler-sample-todo/doppler-sample-todo.jsexe`.
